# Fundamentals of the CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor)

## General Description
A Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is a type of chemical reactor where reactants enter continuously and products exit continuously, maintaining constant volume. The agitator ensures perfect mixing, resulting in uniform concentrations and temperatures throughout the reactor.

## Chemical Reaction
The simulated reaction is first-order irreversible: **A → B**

- **Type**: Exothermic reaction (releases heat)
- **Kinetics**: r_A = k * C_A, where k follows the Arrhenius law: k = k0 * exp(-Ea/RT)
- **Reaction enthalpy**: ΔH_r = -60,000 J/mol (negative = exothermic)

## Fundamental Balances

### Mass Balance
For component A:
```
dC_A/dt = (F/V) * (C_A_in - C_A) - r_A
```
Where:
- F: Inlet volumetric flow [L/min]
- V: Reactor volume [L]
- C_A_in: Inlet concentration of A [mol/L]
- C_A: Concentration in the reactor [mol/L]
- r_A: Reaction rate [mol/(L·min)]

### Energy Balance
For the reactor:
```
ρ·Cp·V · dT/dt = F·ρ·Cp·(T_in - T) + r_A·(-ΔH_r)·V - U·A·(T - T_j)
```

For the cooling jacket:
```
ρ_j·Cp_j·V_j · dT_j/dt = F_j·ρ_j·Cp_j·(T_j_in - T_j) + U·A·(T - T_j)
```

Where:
- T: Reactor temperature [K]
- T_j: Jacket temperature [K]
- U: Global heat transfer coefficient [J/(min·L·K)]
- A: Heat transfer area [m²]

## Engineering Concepts

### Reynolds Number (Re)
Indicates flow regime:
- Re < 10: Laminar
- 10 < Re < 10,000: Transition
- Re > 10,000: Turbulent

### Damköhler Number (Da)
Ratio of reaction time to residence time:
```
Da = τ · k
```
Where τ = V/F is the residence time.

### Conversion and Yield
- Conversion of A: X_A = (C_A_in - C_A_out)/C_A_in
- Yield: Depends on selectivity and conversion

## Recommended Operation Case

### Scenario: Controlled increase in inlet temperature to increase conversion
**Description**: To increase reactor conversion while keeping temperature below 320 K and avoiding warnings, the feed temperature is increased by 5 K in a controlled manner.

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Reactor temperature (T) increases moderately
2. Reaction rate (k) increases, increasing conversion
3. Outlet concentration (C_A) decreases (conversion increases)
4. Heat generated increases, but is controlled with cooling

**Operator Actions**:
1. **Monitoring**: Observe increase in T and conversion
2. **Response**: Increase refrigerant flow (F_j) to 30 L/min to keep T < 320 K
3. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust T_j_in if necessary to control T
4. **Preventive Control**: Keep T below 320 K to avoid warnings
5. **Stabilization**: Balance production (conversion) and safety (temperature)

**Learning Objectives**:
- Optimize conversion without compromising safety
- Practice temperature control with cooling
- Understand the trade-off between production and stability
- Learn safe operations in exothermic reactors

## System Parameters
- Reactor volume: 100 L
- Density: 1000 g/L
- Heat capacity: 4.187 J/(g·K)
- U·A coefficient: 800 J/(min·K)
- Activation energy: 83,140 J/mol
- Pre-exponential factor: 3.87 × 10^12 min⁻¹ (adjusted for consistency)

This simulation allows training operators in chemical reactor control under realistic conditions with measurement noise.

**Note**: The graphical interface displays conversion of A instead of outlet concentration for better visualization of reaction changes.
