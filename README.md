# CSTR HMI Training Simulator

This is a standalone executable for the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) Human-Machine Interface (HMI) training simulator.

## How to Use

1. Download the `CSTR_HMI_Training.exe` file.
2. Double-click the executable to run it.
3. The application will automatically open your web browser to the HMI interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.
4. Use the controls to simulate and train on CSTR operations:
   - Adjust manipulated variables (MV): Refrigerant flow, feed flow, coolant temperature.
   - Monitor controlled variables (CV): Reactor temperature, product concentration.
   - View real-time trends and heat balances.
   - Apply perturbations for training scenarios.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- No additional software installation required (all dependencies are included)

## Features

- Dynamic CSTR simulation with real-time updates
- Interactive controls for operator training
- Alarm system for critical conditions
- Trend charts and gauges for monitoring
- Perturbation tools for scenario training

## Notes

- The executable runs a local web server. Keep the console window open while using the application.
- For best experience, ensure no other applications are using port 8050.
